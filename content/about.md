My name is Marijne Schijns. 
I am a PhD student in the group of [Elzo de Wit](https://www.nki.nl/divisions/gene-regulation/de-wit-e-group/) at the NKI, where I analyze large sets of sequencing data. 
In our group, we are intersted in how 3D organization plays a role in gene regulation. 
To investigate this, we use tools that capture chromsome organization, such as 4C and HiC. 

I would like to use this blog to get more experience with writing out analyses and trying out analysis techniques to later be more comfortable applying them to my own research. 
And to just have fun with data sets, analysis, and vizualization of course!
I might also sneak in a blogpost about yarn, books, and wine every once in a while.
